## User manual 
1. Connect trrs cable between two halves.
2. Then only connect your usb c to RIGHT split. 
3. Download [Vial](https://get.vial.today/download/) to remap the keys, or [web vial](https://vial.rocks/) to remap through browser. 
4. The key `Z` and `/` access to `layer 3`. This is a mouse layer, it automatically triggers `snip`, cursor will move slower. 

### Notes
1. :warning: This step is crucial to prevent bricking the MCU. When connecting a split keyboard, it is important to ensure proper and correct connections. Please refer to [demo](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CdpYrWBJuD9/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) here.
2. If you brick your MCU, your board will no longer function. You will need to replace the set of MCUs if the MCU is bricked.
3. :warning: For RGB per-key users, it is recommended to set the brightness to a maximum of 50% only. Setting it higher than that may result in an unstable power supply to the USB, potentially causing the keyboard to disconnect from your PC.
4. This version uses TRRS cable instead of TRS cable.
5. If `SCROLL` doesnt work >> make sure your usb c connect to right, not left. 
6. Common issues refer to [Common Issues](https://github.com/superxc3/xcmkb/blob/main/list%20of%20guide/common%20issues.md).


### Key Remap
Download [Vial](https://get.vial.today/download/) for key remap. No flashing is required unless you are purchasing build kit. Basically plug and play. Default keymap inspired from Miryoku layout and defined by Bastard Keyboards. 


The quantum can achieve tap feature such as: Hold as Left Control; tap as Space. Just hover on it and it will explain how it works.

#### Unique user code for trackball
1. DPI+ : the pointer moves faster
2. DPI- : the pointer moves slower
3. SNPI+ : snip moves faster
4. SNPI- : snip moves slower
5. SNP : hold to snip. snip is used for small precision pointing. when we need to point or select on small thing, we use snip
