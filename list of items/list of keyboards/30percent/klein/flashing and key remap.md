|2. Head to `Klein-zmk` in your fork, like mine showing `superxc3`, and that should be your name. Then go to the directory as highlighted in the photo above. |
|3. Now you can start edit your keymap, refer to [Keyboard Codes of ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/codes) to insert correct codes. Also, beware of the prefix like `&kp`, `&mt` etc. |

|4. After you've edited the keymap, go to `Actions` wait for compilation. If everything goes smoothly, download `firmware` to get the zip file.|
