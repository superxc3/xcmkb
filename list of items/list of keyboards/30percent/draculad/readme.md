Build guide by author ![here](https://github.com/MangoIV/dracuLad/blob/master/buildguide.md).

Draculad is a 34-36-key-board. It has aggressive pinky stagger similar to the Kyria but with a slightly alternative thumb cluster to raise comfort for large hands. The thumb cluster is lower than on boards like the Corne keyboard.
