The board is designed by [AlaaSaadAbdo](https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/battoota/tree/main) with [QMK_Firmware](https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/qmk_firmware/tree/develop/keyboards/mabroum/zazu).  We are not responsible for and will not assist with firmware configuration.
Please note that we have 4 extra units available, as we are keeping one for personal use. Once sold out, they are considered sold out.


## User manual 
1. The outer scroll ring may be slightly loose. Weâ€™ve pre-taped it for you. If it becomes loose over time, you can tape the inner part of the ring for added stability.
2. Download [VIAL](https://get.vial.today/download/) to remap the keys. Note that it is VIAL, not VIA.
3. The quantum can achieve tap feature such as: Hold as Left Control; tap as Space. Just hover on it and it will explain how it works.
