## Key Remap
Using QMK [VIA](https://github.com/superxc3/xcmkb/blob/main/list%20of%20guide/key%20remap.md). Corne is officially supported by VIA, hence auto-detected when you launch VIA. Common usage of VIA can refer [here](https://github.com/superxc3/xcmkb/blob/main/list%20of%20guide/via-guide.md). 

You also can use VIAL, download [here](https://get.vial.today/download/). The key remap part is more straight forward in VIAL through Quantum tab. 

The quantum can achieve tap feature such as: Hold as Left Control; tap as Space. Just hover on it and it will explain how it works.
