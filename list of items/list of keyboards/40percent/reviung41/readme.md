# Reviung41

The REVIUNG41 is 41-key column staggered keyboard. It is designed by [gtips](https://github.com/gtips/reviung). 

Our acrylic layer case is modified according to gtips's with a few improvements as follow:
- Now support screw-in stabs (tested with Durcok JWK V2 screw-in stabs)
- Acrylic legs for about 7 degree angle
