## Install Stabs
Remove the top screws, take out the PCB and insert the modded 2u screw in or pcb-mounted stab. 

**If stab cant be tigten, try to remove the rubber washer from the stab.*

## Insert Switches
All switch plates can insert without dissemble except for polycarbonate switch plate. However, it is a good practice to insert switches by following the guide below especially for first time usage. The guide below avoid bent switches.

1. Remove the top screw.
2. Remove the switch plate.
3. Push the switch one by one to the switch plate first, fill it up with switches. Do notice the orientation of the switch.
4. Place the filled switch plate on the board.
5. Push gently to make sure no gap between switch plate and acrylic layers below.
6. Tighten the screws.
