# Atlantis PS17 Numpad

This board is designed by Atlantis and we XCMKB are their vendor in Malaysia. We do have stock of top plate (black matte black or frosted transparent) if you wish to change for new look on your numpad. We also can customise for brass plate, dm us for details!

## What do you need?
1. 17mx switches 
2. 17 numpad keycaps

## What is included?
1. Pre-assembled board
2. Aluminium knob
3. 3 sets of 2u pcb-mounted stabs (however recommend to upgrade with better one)
4. Type C cable
5. Atlantis badge (while stocks last)

**free stabs are not installed because we wish you to upgrade for better stabs instead, unscrew bottom to install stabs*

## Possible upgrade
1. Screw-in stabs (tested with Durock JWK V2), mod and lube for the best experience
2. Other design aluminium knobs, with 6mm diameter shaft.
