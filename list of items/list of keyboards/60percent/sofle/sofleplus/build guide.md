## Power Button
This is for wireless build only, wired build please skip to next session. This session guides you for power button and bridge the jumpers for nice!view. The jumper of nice!view on left pcb at the bottom, for right slave on top.

## MCU Socket and TRS Jack 
Use tape to fix the position of MCU socket and TRS jack (if you are building wired) on top of pcb. Solder from bottom.

## MCU
Insert the pins, put the MCU on top and start soldering. Please note that both MCU are facing upwards. Solder MCU before OLED socket. 

## OLED Socket and OLED
We provide 5-pins sockets for OLED allows you to go for nice!view oled in the future.
