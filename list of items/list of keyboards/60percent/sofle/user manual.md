### MX user
- For pom / carbon fibre switch plate, prepare switch puller. It is advised to remove the switch plate and insert the switches one by one rather than inserting them directly.
- For 3D printed switch plates, it is generally recommended to insert the switches directly without removing the switch plate.

### LP choc user
- No switch plate can properly lock the switch. When you remove the keycap, the switch will be pulled along with it. If the switch is locked in the switch plate, you can either wiggle the switch and pull it out, or disassemble the board and push the switch from the bottom of the PCB.

### Key Remap
Download [Vial](https://get.vial.today/download/) for key remap. No flashing is required unless you are purchasing build kit. Basically plug and play. 

The quantum can achieve tap feature such as: Hold as Left Control; tap as Space. Just hover on it and it will explain how it works.
