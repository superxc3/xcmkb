# Low Profile or Choc Switches

This variant of switch is different from mx style switch that is commonly used by mechanical keyboard users. Low profile or choc switch has lower travel distance as well as lower height. However, as ergonomic keyboard, low profile keyboard is another "marginalised" community in the keyboard circle. 

## V1
There is many different variant of low profile choc switch though. We will not introduce here, but just guide you which kind of switch you should purchase. The correct and widely used one is "V1". It is dedicated keycap due to the unique stem. 


## V2
Some people may notice there is this V2 variant which can utilise the normal mx keycap. It is true that there is some mx keycap such as dsa etc can be "reused". However, most of the pcb / board does not support the V2 variant. The butt of the V2 is bigger, while most of the board has smaller hole, not big enough to fit the butt. Hence, most of the pcb / board here does not support V2 variant, this includes [Sofle Choc](https://github.com/superxc3/xcmkb/tree/main/list%20of%20items/list%20of%20keyboards/60percent/sofle/sofle%20choc). 

## Keycaps
You can get low profile keycaps from these two sources but not limit to: Kailh & MBK. 

### Kailh 
The most budget low profile keycaps, choices available: blank black, blank milky white, blank transparent, legended shine through black

### MBK
The more expensive MBK keycaps provide with many other variations. There is local vendor of MBK which saves up our shipping a lot.
