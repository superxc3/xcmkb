# Low Profile or Choc Switches

This variant of switch is different from mx style switch that is commonly used by mechanical keyboard users. Low profile or choc switch has lower travel distance as well as lower height. 

## V1
There is many different variant of low profile choc switch though. We will not introduce here, but just guide you which kind of switch you should purchase. The widely used one is "V1".

### Notes
1. Old switch design comes with a balance wire bar within the switch, making it noisy, but the price is slightly cheaper.
2. Choc clicky has the problem that, it may actuate before you really click the switch.
3. It is not recommended to get tactile choc because it turns to be scracthy linear due to short travel distance, unless you have sunset tactile.
4. Sunset choc tactile is not available here.

## Keycaps for V1
- MBK - more flat, lower profile, wider surface, ridge homing key
- CFX - more budget, higher profile, smaller size led to extra gap between keys




## V2
Some people may notice there is this V2 variant which can utilise the normal mx keycap. It is true that there is some mx keycap such as dsa etc can be "reused". However, most of the pcb / board does not support the V2 variant. The butt of the V2 is bigger, while most of the board has smaller hole, not big enough to fit the butt. Hence, most of the pcb / board here does not support V2 variant, this includes [Sofle Choc](https://github.com/superxc3/xcmkb/tree/main/list%20of%20items/list%20of%20keyboards/60percent/sofle/sofle%20choc).
