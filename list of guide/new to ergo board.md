# New to Ergo Board Guide

This is written based on my personal experience of using ergo boards for past few years. There is no "right" or "wrong" here but merely just my two cents.

### **Recommended Journey / Transition:**

Alice-style unibody -> 60% split -> 40% -> 30%

## Alice-style Unibody 
Example: Alice / Sesame

Recommended to start with unsplit and dedicated arrow cluster. Basically it takes very less time to adapt to this layout, it is designed close to the normal staggered board you used before. However, with the layout oriented so your wrist can be placed properly. 


## Columnar Staggered vs Normal Staggered Layout

Before we proceed to other ergo choices, we would like to introduce "columnar staggered" and "normal staggered layout". Our ergo boards are mostly with columnar staggered keyboard layout, it is hard for beginner to transform from normal staggered to columnar staggered layout. However, the columnar staggered layout actually let you to move your fingers less, every key becomes easier to reach if you have adapted to it. If you notice, the columnar staggered is designed according to your finger length as well. You may refer to type of layout as picture below:

Some splits also comes with "ortholinear layout". Frankly, I think it looks cute and neat; but does not follow the length of fingers which may make your fingers cramp when typing on ortholinear. Hence, I actually promote columnar staggered rather than ortholinear and normal staggered. Alice-style is easy to start with and some people are contented with alice-style, but I think that is just a transitional board if you are looking for a more effective, customisable keymap, and more ergo board. Might as well go to the following columnar staggered board and skip Alice-style.

## Unibody / Unsplit
Alice-style and reviung are unibody / unsplit. It is easier to adapt as the typing posture is more similar to the way we used to do. Split requires us to open our shoulder wider, hence may reduce your typing speed however it is believed that better for your muscle. 

## Split
Alice-style soothes your wrist, however split might work better in a way.

## 60% Split
Some might ask, why skip 75% split? For ergo users, we are looking for "practical" typing experience. The columnar layout itself makes the travel distance of fingers lesser, most of our keys are binded with shortcut or layers. We dont really need the F row, and the dedicated arrow cluster as well. However, preference. I can imagine some people really want that dedicated arrow clusters to skip video etc., hence some 60% split still comes with dedicated arrow cluster. 

### Remap and Layers

### The Numpad Power
Yes. I need numpad. No matter what I need numpad for calculation etc. However, the alice-clone does not allowed me to play with numpad layer due to the normal staggered. The columnar staggered layout itself can mimic the design of numpad, which is one of the reason why I switch to columnar staggered.

### Oleds
Some people prefer boards to be as simple as no oleds and rotary encoders, but they are fancy to play with for beginners though. Oleds can be customised to something else, for example layer indicator, logo, capslock, as well as animated pet. However, that requires you to explore QMK and edit the codes accordingly. An animated pet occupies a large portion of space, which at the end some practical users wave the oled and adding it more functions like tap dance, combo etc to the boards. 

## Why Sofle? 
**Sofle** is the most popular ergo boards for new ergo users. Thanks to their features of having both oleds and rotary encoders. There are 60% splits such as Lily etc. Sofle V2 is an enhanced version of Sofle V1, while V1 layout is designed to be similar to Lily. Seeing that V2 is the improved layout from Lily and V1, we then decided to go for Sofle V2 as our main product. You can find the designer note [here](https://josef-adamcik.cz/electronics/soflekeyboard-evolving.html) for Sofle.

### Highly customisable 
Since it is an open source board, you can customise the board yourself. You may opt to print 3d case, many downloads or design available [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=sofle+v2&type=things&sort=relevant). You may also find people add encoders or pimoroni trackball on the Sofle, it is mostly doable as long as you have interest to try and play with it.

## 40% 
After you are happy with 60% boards, you will soon be interest in a smaller board to challenge yourself. 40% is so much cuter and smaller. It allows more space on your table. As long as you started play with layers on 60% board, it wont be hard for you to proceed with 40%. 

## 30% 
30 percent is an even sweeter board, however it is very hard to adapt and requires many tapping and combo. I myself is not brave enough to step into it, although built one draculad with pimoroni trackball. There are users in Malaysia who love 30% and find it as the sweetest layout size especially it is very portable.
