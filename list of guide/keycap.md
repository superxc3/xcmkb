# Keycap Choices

Ergonomic board mostly relies on "ortholinear" keycaps, or "40" keycaps. They have more 1u than normal keycap set you are using. If you are not very particular on the legend, you can utilise your existing keycap set, as long as it can fill the board. 

We recommend flat profile keycap because there is no worry on height and profile issue. As the most typical cherry profile has different height each row, same applies to SA, MT3 etc. However flat profile like NP, XDA, DSA eliminate the profile difference and height issues.
