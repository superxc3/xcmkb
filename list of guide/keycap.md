# Keycap Choices

## Choosing keycaps for your ergonomic board
Ergonomic boards often use "ortholinear" keycaps. These keycaps have suitable thumb keys and more 1u-sized keys with proper legend. If you're not too concerned about the legend, you can use keycaps from your existing cherry or OEM profile sets, as long as they fit the board.

## Why we recommend flat profile keycaps
We recommend flat profile keycaps because they eliminate worries about keycap height and profile issues. Typical profiles like cherry, SA, MT3, and others have varying heights for each row. Flat profiles like NP, XDA, and DSA ensure consistent height across all keys. However, it's a matter of personal preference, and some people like the varied heights of other profiles. Feel free to explore and find what suits your typing style!

## Sofle requirement
1. 56 x 1u keycaps
2. 2 x 1.5u keycaps (or smaller than 1.5u can fit as well)

## Corne 42 keys requirement
1. 40 x 1u keycaps
2. 2 x 1.5u keycaps (or smaller than 1.5u can fit as well)

## XC's preference
I find both flat profile keycaps (such as ADA) and keycaps of varying heights (such as MT3 and Cherry) to be comfortable. Cherry keycap has a lower profile, whereas MT3 keycaps feature deep dish surfaces, creating a tactile sensation as if your fingers are resting on the keycaps and being cradled. Additionally, the higher profile of MT3 produces a deeper sound.

I also have a preference for flipping the bottom row upside down because it feels more comfortable for my thumb. If you're a fan of MT3 keycaps, you can usually find them in the aftermarket or keep an eye out for BONGOCAT promotions on Drop.com, where they often offer a buy one, get one free deal.
