# Common Issues

#### Certain keys are not registered
- Check any bent pins on your switch. It is recommended to insert the switch properly by following [this method](https://github.com/superxc3/xcmkb/blob/main/list%20of%20items/list%20of%20keyboards/60percent/sofle/user%20manual.md#step-4), it is a proper way of inserting switches. 
However do note that switches cannot be inserted properly for acrylic switch plate due to the thickness of acrylic.
- Your cable might be not a data cable which can transmit data. This happens very often on micro usb cable. Try with another cable or buy a usb data cable.

#### Rows or columns registered together
