# Design and Development

This is the progress of design and development for Sofle. 

## Pimoroni Trackball and Haptic Bzzz Support
These are common and can be hand-wired as well as many users shared these in Reddit. Haptic Bzzz is inspired by [Solar Tempest](https://github.com/solartempest). Currently plan to draw a PCB to allocate for several features listed in following session. 

#### Small pcb for hotswappable pimoroni items
First attempt: 2022.01.21
- Hotswap OLED screen
- Hotswap Pimoroni Trackball (plan to allocate at right split)
- Hotswap Pimoroni Haptic Bzzz (plan to allocate at left split; might not be possible as Pimoroni devices might only work on the master side?)
