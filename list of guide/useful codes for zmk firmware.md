# Useful Codes for ZMK Firmware

Example of issues faced

### 1 Bluetooth cannot be paired or unsuccessful
You will need to clear bluetooth profile everytime you re-flash with new firmware or u2f. 
Let's say you have paired Profile 1 to desktop, and Profile 2 to Ipad. When you BT Clear, it does not clear all the two profiles you have paired. Meaning, you have to select BT1>BT Clear; and BT2>BT Clear.
